    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you're a fan of our banana bread, then you're gonna love this, since it's based on that recipe. As easy as that is to make, these are even easier. I really think that this threads the needle between something that has the flavor of banana bread, but that is very close to the texture of a classic pancake. Top with butter and banana slices and serve with warm maple syrup.</p>
    <p>Our banana bread is one of the most popular and well-reviewed videos I've ever posted. When I got the idea to do banana bread pancakes, I decided to use that lovely loaf as the base recipe.</p>
    <p>Of course, you can't just thin out a bread recipe like that with more liquid and expect perfect pancakes. I began what I assumed would be a long series of experiments, eventually leading to the perfect formula.</p>
    <p>So, you can imagine my shock when I nailed it on the first attempt. Like they say, it's better to be lucky than good. I didn't want banana-flavored pancakes, nor did I want pan-fried banana bread dough. Rather, I wanted a perfect hybrid of both — and that's pretty much what happened here.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 large ripe banana</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a small bowl with a whisk. Reserve until needed.</li>
        <li>Place banana in a mixing bowl and mash into a smooth paste with a potato masher. Add egg and sugar and whisk thoroughly until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add milk, vanilla extract, 1/4 cup melted butter, walnuts, and flour mixture. Whisk until just combined.</li>
        <li>Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large, nonstick pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, transfer in about 1/3 cup of the batter per pancake. Reduce heat to medium and cook until edges start to look dry and small air bubbles pop up through the surface, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
